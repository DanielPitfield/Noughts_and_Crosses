# Noughts_and_Crosses
An online implementation of the 'Noughts and Crosses' game.

A move can be made by clicking on any available position of the game board.

The game has two modes which can be toggled using the buttons below the game board:

* **Player vs AI:** After every move made by the human player, an AI opponent will make a move (the move this AI opponent makes is determined by an evaluation of the minimax algorithm, the human player is at best only able to draw and can never win)

* **Player vs Player:** The symbol (Nought or Cross) changes with every move made allowing for two human players to play against one another

When the game has finished, the outcome of the game will be displayed. 

The game can be restarted at any point by pressing the 'Restart' button.

### Known Issues
* Use of Bootstrap (and jQuery) is unjustified
* Interface design and element styling is poor
* Limited responsiveness of the webpage (the positioning and sizing of the game board is sometimes unintuitive)
